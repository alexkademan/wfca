excerpt: Job site safety begins by selecting a WFCA contractor. WFCA has created an effective and in-depth safety program.

---

There are many ways that accidents on the job site can be avoided. When selecting your contractor, you should always ask how your contractor approaches safety. It is important to know the effectiveness of your contractors safety program. No one wants to be issued a citation by OSHA and have your project shut down!

For construction, the 10 OSHA standards most frequently included in citations were:

*	Scaffolding
*	Fall protection (scope, application, definitions, training requirements)
*	Excavations (general requirements, requirements for protective systems)
*	Ladders
*	Head protection
*	Hazard communication
*	Construction (general safety and health provisions)
*	Electrical (wiring methods, design and protection)

WFCAâ€™s members maintain jobsite safety by indepth and proper training for all new employees. Each employee has been trained and instructed on how to address risks and hazards that can exist on the job, and are fully instructed on the use of all equipment and each piece of protective equipment.
