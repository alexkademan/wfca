WFCA’s members maintain jobsite safety by indepth and proper training of every employee. Each employee has been trained and instructed on how to address risks and hazards that can exist on the job, and are fully instructed on when, how, and why to use each piece of protective equipment.

There are many ways that accidents on the job site can be avoided but the first place to start is when selecting your contractor. You should always ask how your contractor approaches safety. It is important to know the effectiveness of your contractors safety program. No one wants to be issued a citation by OSHA and have your project shut down!

For construction, the 10 OSHA standards most frequently included in the agency's citations were:

*	Scaffolding
*	Fall protection (scope, application, definitions)
*	Excavations (general requirements)
*	Ladders
*	Head protection
*	Excavations (requirements for protective systems)
*	Hazard communication
*	Fall protection (training requirements)
*	Construction (general safety and health provisions)
*	Electrical (wiring methods, design and protection)

Drug and alcohol use in the Construction Industry is dangerous. Poor decision-making and slowed reaction times from drugs and/or alcohol use can cause serious on-site trouble. According to the latest National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the construction industry has the highest rates of workplace drug use. The US Department of Labor has posted that the drug and alcohol use by construction workers is at an all time high. These laborers create risk on the job site affecting overall job safety and work efficiency and productivity.
substance abuse is the factor in:

* 35% of absenteism
* 38-50% of all workers' compensation claims 
* 40% of employee thefts, 

*according to the [Eighth Special Report to the US Congress on Alcohol and Health][special-report], and the [US Department of Labor][US-dept-labor]. 

### OSHA has defined construction workers “Fatal Four” fatalities as:

* **35% - Falls**
* **9% - Electrocutions**
* **10% - Struck by Object **
* **3% -Caught-in/between**


Job site injury directly affects a company's workers' compensation experience-rating modification factors.

Due to the high accident rates in the construction industry it is imperative  to take the necessary steps to implement drug testing programs and procedures that will increase construction safety and worker productivity.

It is vital to implement drug testing in the workplace and is shown to be an effective method for reducing the number of impaired workers on a project site, increasing project safety, productivity, and profits.
