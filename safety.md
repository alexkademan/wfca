There are many ways that accidents on the job site can be avoided but the first place to start is when selecting your contractor. You should always ask how your contractor approaches safety. It is important to know the effectiveness of your contractors safety program. No one wants to be issued a citation by OSHA and have your project shut down!

For construction, the 10 OSHA standards most frequently included in citations were:

*	Scaffolding
*	Fall protection (scope, application, definitions)
*	Excavations (general requirements)
*	Ladders
*	Head protection
*	Excavations (requirements for protective systems)
*	Hazard communication
*	Fall protection (training requirements)
*	Construction (general safety and health provisions)
*	Electrical (wiring methods, design and protection)

WFCAâ€™s members maintain jobsite safety by indepth and proper training of every employee. Each employee has been trained and instructed on how to address risks and hazards that can exist on the job, and are fully instructed on the use of all equipment and each piece of protective equipment.
