**WFCA** gathers monthly to discuss and review a wide range of industry topics. From safety training and drug testing to risk management and new legislation, WFCA works diligently to create open communication so their members have a voice to express their needs and concerns, provide their observations and input as well as receive information on industry topics that are current and relevant. WFCAâ€™s primary mission is and always has been, to build a strong membership base relying on the solidarity of their peers. This results in a community based upon mutual industry interests and objectives, creating an information based platform.
